## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to identify opportunities and generate recommendations for Microsoft Studios in anticipation of their new film production company.
Since Microsoft has no prior experience in film production this analysis serves to create a strategy for success utilizing market data. To gain this insight we will use data from IMDB, and The Numbers to find trends in genre, finance, and talent.
 
## Data Used
Data used for this project was sourced from IMDB, and The Numbers.
IMDB contains descriptive information about thousands of movies. Such as year released, genre, ratings, and title. IMDB also contains descriptive information about thousands of people in the film industry.

By combining the IMDB movie data, talent data, and The Numbers financial data we will be able to ascertain trends in the film industry.
